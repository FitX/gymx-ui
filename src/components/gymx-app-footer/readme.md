GymxAppFooter provides two slots through which content and actions, such as links or text, can be embedded.

### Slots

- **content**: Slot for the main content of the footer (e.g., version number or copyright).
- **actions**: Slot for links, buttons, or other actions in the footer.

Currently, this component does not use any props.
The content is managed exclusively through the slots.
